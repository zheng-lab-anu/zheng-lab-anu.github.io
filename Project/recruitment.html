<p class="elegant"><font size=6><strong>Currently Open Positions </strong></font></p> 
<p class="elegant">We are looking for candidates on different academic levels, including 2 Postdocs, 3 PhD students and some interns. Our group is led by A/Prof Yi Yang (<a href="http://www.escience.cn/people/YiYang/index.html"><font color="blue">homepage 1</font></a>, <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~yiyang/"><font color="blue">homepage 2</font></a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RMSuNFwAAAAJ&hl=en"><font color="blue">Google Scholar</font></a>). We currently have a very strong team of about 20 PhD students working on various research fields, e.g., video analysis (event detection, question and answering, captioning), person re-identification, and machine learning. </p> 


<p class="elegant"><font size=5><strong>Postdoc </strong></font></p> 
<p class="elegant"> The Postdoc candidate should have a PhD degree, and will be working with Dr. Yang and me on a person re-identification project. The candidate thus should have expertise in person re-identification/deep learning/image retrieval. The candidate should also have strong coding skills. Strong publication record in top-venues in computer vision and machine learning is a plus. The position is intended for 2 years, and can be renewable. Salary is very competitive. </p> 

<p class="elegant">If interested, please send a detailed CV with a publication list to yi.yang@uts.edu.au and liangzheng06@gmail.com. </p> 

<p class="elegant"><font size=5><strong>PhD </strong></font></p> 
<p class="elegant">We are looking for candidates for 4-year PhD positions in machine learning and computer vision at the University of Technology Sydney. The perspective PhD student will be working with Dr. Yang and me in designing new machine learning and computer vision algorithms. PhD scholarships will be provided. Successful candidates will be working with Dr. Yang and me, and will be provided with strong technical/research support to publish in the internationally recognized venues. </p> 

<p class="elegant">The candidate should have strong coding abilities. For undergraduates, it is important to have some ability to do independent research. For those with a master degree, it is preferred that some publication record be provided. </p> 

<p class="elegant">If interested, please send a detailed CV with a publication list/research experience to yi.yang@uts.edu.au and liangzheng06@gmail.com. </p> 

<p class="elegant"><font size=5><strong>Intern </strong></font></p> 
<p class="elegant">The intern can choose to work in either UTS or Beijing. The intern will usually work with graduate students on research/industrial problems. Intern funding depends. We welcome intern students who receive funding from their universities. It is likely that some research output, e.g., papers and industrial products, can be made. </p>

<p class="elegant">The candidate should have strong coding skills and motivations in research or industrial applications. Research/project experience is a plus. If interested, please send a detailed CV with a publication list/research experience to yi.yang@uts.edu.au and liangzheng06@gmail.com.</p>
